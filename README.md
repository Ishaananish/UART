# UART Communication Protocol

The Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) is a widely used communication protocol for serial communication between devices. This repository provides an overview of the UART protocol, its features, implementation examples, and more.


## Introduction

The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) protocol is a simple and widely used communication standard for transmitting data between devices. It allows data transmission over a single wire, making it suitable for various applications, including microcontroller communication, sensor interfaces, and more.

## Features

- **Simplicity:** UART is straightforward to implement and is commonly supported by a wide range of microcontrollers and communication modules.

- **Half-Duplex Communication:** UART supports half-duplex communication, where data can be transmitted in one direction at a time.

- **Widely Supported Baud Rates:** The protocol supports a variety of baud rates, allowing for flexible communication speed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of digital communication concepts.
- Familiarity with programming languages used for microcontrollers



### Asynchronous Communication

UART uses asynchronous communication, where data is transmitted without a clock signal. Instead, it relies on the start and stop bits to frame the data bytes.
